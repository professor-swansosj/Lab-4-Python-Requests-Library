## Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you:
- Completed Lab 3: Introduction to APIs (you should already know what an API is, how to identify URL, method, headers, body, and status code).
- Installed and used Postman to make basic API requests and learned how to export a request.
- Run basic cURL commands to test an API from the terminal.
- Worked with GitHub Classroom repositories and Dev Containers (cloning a repo, opening in VS Code, and confirming the environment).
- Comfort with writing and running a Python script from a `.py` file.
- Basic understanding of variables, strings, loops, and conditionals.
- Awareness of Python functions (we‚Äôll practice structuring code into functions in this lab).

**:brain: Mindset**
- Curiosity and patience: APIs sometimes return unexpected results, and your job is to explore, debug, and adapt.

**INSERT THIS CODE SNIPPET AT THE VERY TOP OF YOUR CODE RIGHT AFTER YOUR IMPORT STATEMENTS. IF A LOG MESSAGE IS REQUIRED AT ANY TIME IT WILL BE ANNOTAED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS.**
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from pathlib import Path

def now_iso():
    return datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat().replace("+00:00","Z")

def log(line, path):
    # Ensure logs directory exists even if student runs from repo root
    Path("logs").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    with open(path, "a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(f"{line} ts={now_iso()}\n")

# usage examples:
# log("LAB4_START", "logs/jokes_json.log")
# log("LAB4_HTTP_OK status=200", "logs/high_card.log")
# log('LAB4_ERR type=Timeout msg="request timed out"', "logs/jokes_loop.log")
```

**Where to put it (student message)**
- Open each file in `src/` (`jokes_postman_export.py`, `jokes_json.py`, `jokes_loop.py`, `high_card.py`).
- Place the snippet immediately after your `import` statements.
- Use `log("...","logs/<matching-log>.log")` at each required milestone listed above.
- Commit and push when done. The autograder reads the `logs/*.log` files to award points.

## Overview
In this lab you‚Äôll move from testing APIs in Postman (Lab 3) into actually writing Python code that calls APIs, handles responses, and turns them into usable programs. The focus is the requests library, one of the most common tools developers use when working with APIs in Python.

You‚Äôll begin by exporting a Dad Jokes API call from Postman, running it in Python, and printing the raw text response. From there, you‚Äôll request JSON instead of plain text, parse it into a Python dictionary, and use pretty print to display the results cleanly. Once you can extract the "joke" field, you‚Äôll practice output formatting with a fun f-string like:
Your daily joke is: <the joke>

The second half of the lab introduces the Deck of Cards API. You‚Äôll make multiple requests to shuffle and draw cards, then use that data to power a simple ‚Äúhighest card wins‚Äù game where you play against the computer. Each round, the script compares card values and announces the winner, looping until you decide to stop.

By the end of the lab, you‚Äôll have written two small but functional programs that combine Python fundamentals‚Äîrequests, JSON parsing, loops, conditionals, and user input‚Äîwith real APIs. This sets the stage for more advanced automation projects later in the course.

üí° **Why this matters:** Modern networks cannot be managed manually at scale. Automation skills give you an edge as a job candidate and make you more effective in real-world environments.

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1 ‚Äì Clone the Repository
Open your GitHub Classroom repository for Lab 4 on your local machine. Make sure you are inside the repository folder before you continue.

Why this matters: This ensures all your work is tracked in Git, organized in the right folder structure, and ready to push back for grading.

### Step 2 ‚Äì Open a Dev Container
Open the repository in VS Code. Reopen the project in a Dev Container when prompted. The container will automatically install Python, required libraries, and set up your environment.

This may take a few minutes the first time you start it. Wait until the container is fully ready.

Log Requirement:
Your logs/lab4_devcontainer.log file should include the line:
[STEP 2] Dev Container Started


### Step 3 ‚Äì Export a Postman request into Python
Using the Dad Jokes API request you built in Lab 3, export that request as Python code from Postman. Save it as your first script inside src/. Run the script and confirm that the response from the API prints to your terminal.

Goal: Move from testing in Postman into running the same request directly from Python.

Log Requirement:
Your log for this script (`logs/jokes_postman_export.log`) should show that you started the script, ran the exported request, received a response, and printed it.


### Step 4 ‚Äì Work with JSON responses
Update your Dad Jokes request so that it asks for JSON instead of plain text. Convert the response into a Python dictionary and pretty-print the output so it‚Äôs easier to read.

Goal: Understand that APIs often return JSON and that Python can easily convert and display that data.

Log Requirement:
Your log for this script (`logs/jokes_json.log`) should show that you requested JSON, successfully loaded it, and pretty-printed the result.


### Step 5 ‚Äì Extract a single field
From the JSON response, find the `"joke"` field and print it in a friendly message using a formatted string.

Goal: Practice pulling out a specific piece of data from a JSON response and displaying it in a user-friendly way.

Log Requirement:
Your log (`logs/jokes_json.log`) should confirm that the "joke" field was found and printed.

### Step 6 ‚Äì Add a simple loop
Make your joke script interactive. After printing a joke, ask the user if they want another one. Continue looping until the user decides to stop.

Goal: Combine API requests with loops and user input to make your script interactive.

Log Requirement:
Your log (`logs/jokes_loop.log`) should show each loop round beginning, the joke being fetched, and whether the user continued or stopped.

### Step 7 ‚Äì Use the Deck of Cards API
Connect to the Deck of Cards API. Create a new shuffled deck and save its unique identifier. Then draw cards from it.

Goal: Learn how some APIs require multiple requests that build on each other. The `deck_id` you receive from the first request will be used in later requests.

Log Requirement:
Your log (`logs/high_card.log`) should show that the deck was created successfully and include the deck ID.

### Step 8 ‚Äì Build a ‚Äúhighest card wins‚Äù game
Draw one card for yourself and one for the computer from the same deck. Compare the two card values and announce who wins. Handle ties appropriately. Let the user play multiple rounds until they quit.

Goal: Apply program logic and API data together to create a functional game loop.

Log Requirement:
Your log (`logs/high_card.log`) should show the card drawn for each player, the comparison made, the winner of each round, and whether the game continued or ended.

### Step 9 ‚Äì Wrap up with error handling and polish
Add basic error handling to your scripts. For example, log a clear error message if an API request fails or the JSON response is missing expected fields. Make sure your scripts end gracefully.

Goal: Build resilience into your programs and practice writing logs for both success and failure cases.

Log Requirement:
Any controlled error you catch should be logged in the proper log file with an `ERR` marker.

### Step 10 ‚Äì Open a Pull Request
When you have finished and tested your scripts, push your changes to GitHub. Open a Pull Request (PR) in your Classroom repository. Your instructor and the autograder will use the PR to review your logs and code.

Goal: Submit your work in a professional workflow used by real developers.

## Troubleshooting
1. Dev Container Didn‚Äôt Install Dependencies
    - Symptom: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests' when running scripts.
    - Fix: Make sure you‚Äôre running code inside the Dev Container. Confirm requests is installed by listing installed packages. If missing, reinstall with the requirements file.

2. No Internet Access from Container
    - Symptom: API calls fail with timeouts or DNS errors.
    - Fix: Rerun the health check script (.devcontainer/health_check.py) to confirm connectivity. If DNS resolution fails, stop and rebuild your container.

3. Got HTML Instead of JSON
    - Symptom: Response prints a long HTML page instead of JSON or text.
    - Fix: APIs often require headers to specify the format. For the Dad Jokes API, include a header that asks for JSON if you need structured data.

4. KeyError on JSON Fields
    - Symptom: Script crashes when trying to access data["joke"].
    - Fix: Check the raw JSON response first. If the key name doesn‚Äôt exist (or is spelled wrong), Python will throw a KeyError. Always inspect what fields are actually returned.

5. Infinite Joke Loop
    - Symptom: Script never stops fetching jokes even after typing ‚Äúno‚Äù.
    - Fix: Normalize your input (yes/no) by trimming spaces and making it lowercase before checking it. Handle unexpected input by reprompting the user.

6. Deck of Cards Draw Doesn‚Äôt Work
    - Symptom: You get an error or empty result when drawing cards.
    - Fix: Make sure you‚Äôre passing the deck_id from the first API call into the second. Without it, the API doesn‚Äôt know which deck you‚Äôre using.

7. Card Comparison Always Wrong
    - Symptom: The wrong winner is declared, or face cards don‚Äôt compare correctly.
    - Fix: Remember that "ACE", "KING", "QUEEN", and "JACK" are strings. You need to map them to numeric values before comparing.

8. Logs Not Created or Empty
    - Symptom: Autograder shows missing points even though your script worked.
    - Fix: Double-check that you added the logging snippet to the top of your scripts and that you‚Äôre writing to the correct logs/*.log file. Each required marker must be written as specified.

9. GitHub Autograder Fails
    - Symptom: Points deducted even though everything seems correct locally.
    - Fix: Verify that file names and paths match instructions exactly. Confirm that all log markers are present. Push your code and logs before opening your Pull Request.

## :light_bulb: Pro Tips
- Always Inspect Raw JSON First

Before pulling fields, print the full JSON response once. This helps you confirm key names and structure.

- Pretty Print Early, Debug Easier

Use pprint when looking at nested JSON objects. It makes errors much easier to spot.

- Use Functions for Clarity

Even small scripts benefit from breaking into functions like get_joke() or draw_card(). It keeps your code organized and easier to test.

- Handle Errors Gracefully

Wrap API requests in try/except and log a clear error marker (LAB4_ERR ...). Professional scripts always fail predictably.

- Think in Loops and Conditions

Most real automation isn‚Äôt ‚Äúone-and-done.‚Äù Practice using loops with exit conditions and conditionals that branch based on data.

- Map Your Data Once, Reuse It

Create a single dictionary for card values at the top of your script, then reuse it every round. It‚Äôs cleaner than rewriting logic each time.

- Keep Logs Human + Machine Friendly

Your log lines should be short enough for the autograder to parse, but also clear enough that you can debug by reading them.

- Stretch Goal: Make the Game Fun

Add suit symbols (‚ô•, ‚ô¶, ‚ô£, ‚ô†) or use string formatting to display rounds cleanly. While not graded, polish makes your project stand out.
